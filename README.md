Project Summary
Bright  Boost is  an  after-school program that  provides  tutoring  for  high  school  students. 
Students from local high schools can enrol in the program for a small fee, which is paid yearly 
or per term, and can then attend Bright Boost sessions any number of weekdays after school. 
Sessions run from 3:30pm to 5:30pm and are staffed by one or more tutors depending on the 
day. Each tutor has expertise in one or more subject areas. Sessions are run on a drop-in, first- 
come-first-served basis, where students can ask questions or simply use the space to work in. 
Currently, tutors write their name and areas of expertise on a white board at the front of the 
room, and students raise their hand if they have a question.

If possible, they would also be interested in knowing details about the content of the questions, 
when they were asked, which tutor answered, and possibly even how much of the tutor’s time 
was required to address it. They are also open to collecting any other data you feel would be 
useful for their business.
They are not sure how this data should be entered – staff could record that they have answered 
a question after doing so, or the system could double as a queue where students enter that 
they would like help instead of just raising their hand.
Bright Boost would also like the system to be able to calculate and display statistics and 
summaries of the data it collects, but they leave the decision of what summaries and statistics 
would be useful to you. They would also be interested in using the system to display a timetable 
of when tutors are scheduled, so students can plan their week accordingly.
